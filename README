# Lite Framework For PHP

This is designed to be a lightweight and fast framework for rapidly developing PHP web applications.

It is in very early stages of development and is not anywhere near being complete.

Take a look at 'http://code.google.com/p/collaborative-development-sem2' -> Live on 'http://uni.sam-giles.co.uk/c=Index' for an example of this framework in use.
